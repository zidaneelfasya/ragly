## Introduction

### What is Ragly?

Ragly is a powerful platform that lets you create smart AI chatbots using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** technology. Unlike generic chatbots, Ragly's chatbots learn from **your specific documents** and provide accurate, relevant answers based on your organization's knowledge.

Think of it as giving your AI assistant a brain filled with your company's manuals, guides, policies, and expertise.

### Who is Ragly for?

Ragly is perfect for:

- **Businesses** looking to automate customer support
- **Educational institutions** wanting to help students with course materials
- **Organizations** needing internal knowledge assistants
- **Teams** who want to make their documentation more accessible
- **Anyone** who wants to create smart chatbots without technical expertise

### What problems does Ragly solve?

- **Information overload**: Instead of searching through hundreds of documents, users can simply ask questions
- **24/7 availability**: Your chatbot works around the clock, even when your team doesn't
- **Consistent answers**: Everyone gets the same accurate information every time
- **Time savings**: Reduce repetitive questions and free up your team for more important work
- **Knowledge accessibility**: Make expert knowledge available to everyone instantly

## Creating a Chatbot

Creating your first chatbot is easy! The process is broken into three simple steps:

### Step 1: Basic Information

1. Click **"Create Chatbot"** from your dashboard
2. **Name your chatbot** (e.g., "Customer Support Assistant" or "HR Helper")
3. **Choose an AI model**:
   - GPT-4 Turbo (recommended for best quality)
   - GPT-3.5 Turbo (faster, good for simple tasks)
4. **Set the language** (English, Spanish, French, etc.)
5. **Choose visibility**:
   - **Private**: Only you can access it
   - **Public**: Anyone with the link can use it
6. **Add personality**: Describe how your chatbot should behave (friendly, professional, helpful, etc.)

### Step 2: Knowledge Base (Documents)

This is where the magic happens! Upload the documents your chatbot will learn from.

### Step 3: Configuration

Fine-tune your chatbot's behavior:

- **Welcome message**: What users see when they start chatting
- **Fallback message**: What to say when the chatbot doesn't know an answer
- **Tone setting**: Professional, casual, friendly, or formal
- **Response creativity**: Control how creative vs. factual the responses are

**Preview your chatbot** on the right side of the screen as you make changes!

## Uploading Documents (Knowledge Base)

Your documents are your chatbot's brain. Here's what you need to know:

### Supported File Formats

Ragly accepts these file types:

- **PDF files** (.pdf) - Perfect for manuals, reports, and guides
- **Word documents** (.docx) - Great for policies and procedures
- **Text files** (.txt) - Simple documents and notes

**File size limit**: Up to 10MB per file

### How to Upload Documents

1. In the Knowledge Base step (or from your chatbot's management page):
2. **Drag and drop** files into the upload area, or click to browse
3. **Select multiple files** at once if needed
4. **Wait for processing** - files are automatically analyzed and indexed
5. **Review the list** of uploaded documents

### How Documents are Used

When someone asks your chatbot a question:

1. The system **searches through all your documents** to find relevant information
2. It **extracts the most helpful parts** related to the question
3. The AI **combines this information** to create a natural, conversational answer
4. **Sources are referenced** so users know where the information came from

**Pro tip**: The more relevant documents you upload, the smarter your chatbot becomes!

## Chatting with the Bot

### How to Ask Questions

Using your chatbot is as simple as having a conversation:

- **Type naturally**: Ask questions like you would ask a human
- **Be specific**: "How do I reset my password?" is better than "password help"
- **Follow up**: Ask clarifying questions if you need more detail

### Examples of Good Questions

- "What's the refund policy for online purchases?"
- "How do I submit a vacation request?"
- "What are the requirements for the marketing certification?"
- "Can you explain the project approval process?"

### How Answers are Generated

Here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. **Question analysis**: The system understands what you're asking
2. **Document search**: It searches through all uploaded documents for relevant information
3. **Context gathering**: The most relevant passages are collected
4. **Answer generation**: AI creates a helpful response using this information
5. **Source linking**: References to original documents are provided

### Getting Better Answers

- **Ask follow-up questions** if you need clarification
- **Be specific** about what you're looking for
- **Use keywords** that might appear in your documents
- **Rephrase** your question if the first answer isn't helpful

## Limitations

✅ **Reference sources** and cite documents  
✅ **Handle follow-up questions** in the same conversation
